# IBM DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS
This repository contains all the projects I completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
Each project focuses on a different stage of the data science lifecycle, helping build strong hands-on skills in Python, data analysis, data visualization and machine learning.
